# 🌟 Alert Tamer AI - Git Workflow Structure

## 📋 **Branch Architecture**

### 🏠 **Main Branch**: `main`
- **Purpose**: Production-ready code integrating all features
- **Role**: Central integration branch for all completed features
- **Protection**: Should be protected from direct pushes

### 🔧 **Feature Branches** (6 branches):

1. **`dashboard`** 📊
   - Main dashboard interface and widgets
   - Real-time threat monitoring
   - System status overview

2. **`settings`** ⚙️
   - Application configuration
   - User preferences
   - System settings management

3. **`reports`** 📈
   - Report generation and export
   - Analytics and statistics
   - Historical data analysis

4. **`threat-analysis`** 🛡️
   - Advanced threat detection algorithms
   - AI model improvements
   - Pattern recognition enhancements

5. **`log-analysis`** 📄
   - Log parsing and processing
   - File upload improvements
   - Multi-format support enhancements

6. **`incident-response`** 🚨
   - Incident management system
   - Response automation
   - Alert handling and notifications

## 🔄 **Development Workflow**

### **Phase 1: Feature Development**
Each team member works on their assigned branch:

```bash
# Switch to your feature branch
git checkout dashboard          # or settings, reports, etc.

# Make your changes and commit
git add .
git commit -m "✨ Add new dashboard feature"

# Push to your feature branch
git push origin dashboard
```

### **Phase 2: Feature Integration**
When a feature is complete, merge it to main:

```bash
# Switch to main branch
git checkout main

# Pull latest changes
git pull origin main

# Merge feature branch
git merge dashboard             # or any other feature branch

# Push updated main
git push origin main
```

### **Phase 3: Keep Branches Updated**
Regularly sync feature branches with main:

```bash
# On your feature branch
git checkout dashboard

# Get latest main changes
git merge main

# Resolve any conflicts if needed
# Push updated feature branch
git push origin dashboard
```

## 📚 **Detailed Workflow Commands**

### **For Feature Developers:**

#### Starting Work:
```bash
# Clone the repository (first time only)
git clone https://github.com/TRIDYY/alert-tamer-ai.git
cd alert-tamer-ai

# Switch to your assigned branch
git checkout your-branch-name

# Start development server
npm run dev:full
```

#### During Development:
```bash
# Check current branch
git branch

# See changes
git status

# Add and commit changes
git add .
git commit -m "🎯 Descriptive commit message"

# Push to your branch
git push origin your-branch-name
```

#### Before Merging:
```bash
# Update your branch with latest main
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout your-branch-name
git merge main

# Resolve conflicts if any
# Test your feature
npm run dev:full

# Push updated branch
git push origin your-branch-name
```

### **For Integration Manager:**

#### Merging Features to Main:
```bash
# Switch to main
git checkout main

# Pull latest
git pull origin main

# Merge feature branch (choose one method)

# Method 1: Direct merge
git merge feature-branch-name

# Method 2: Squash merge (recommended for clean history)
git merge --squash feature-branch-name
git commit -m "🚀 Add [Feature Name] functionality"

# Push to main
git push origin main
```

## 🎯 **Branch Responsibilities**

| Branch | Team Member | Focus Area | Key Features |
|--------|-------------|------------|--------------|
| `dashboard` | Sal | Main Interface | Widgets, metrics, overview |
| `settings` | Shaksham| Configuration | User prefs, system config |
| `reports` | Zails | Analytics | Export, charts, statistics |
| `threat-analysis` | Som | Security | AI models, detection |
| `log-analysis` | Shreyas/Tridash | Processing | File parsing, formats |
| `incident-response` | Shreyas/Tridash | Response | Alerts, automation |

## 🔒 **Best Practices**

### **Commit Messages:**
- Use descriptive prefixes: `✨ feat:`, `🐛 fix:`, `📚 docs:`, `🎨 style:`
- Keep messages clear and specific
- Reference issues when applicable: `fixes #123`

### **Branch Management:**
- Keep branches focused on single features
- Regular commits with meaningful messages
- Test before pushing
- Sync with main regularly

### **Code Review Process:**
1. Create Pull Request from feature branch to main
2. Team review and approval
3. Merge to main
4. Delete merged feature branch (optional)

## 🚀 **Final Integration Timeline**

### **Phase 1**: Individual Feature Development (2-3 weeks)
- Each team works on their branch independently
- Regular progress updates and demos

### **Phase 2**: Feature Integration (1 week)
- Sequential merging of completed features
- Integration testing after each merge
- Conflict resolution

### **Phase 3**: Final Testing & Deployment (1 week)
- Complete system testing
- Bug fixes and refinements
- Production deployment preparation

## 🛠 **Emergency Procedures**

### **Hotfix Process:**
```bash
# Create hotfix branch from main
git checkout main
git checkout -b hotfix/critical-bug-fix

# Make urgent fixes
# ... fix the bug ...

# Commit and merge immediately
git commit -m "🚨 hotfix: Fix critical security issue"
git checkout main
git merge hotfix/critical-bug-fix
git push origin main

# Apply to feature branches if needed
```

### **Rollback Process:**
```bash
# If main has issues, rollback to last working commit
git checkout main
git reset --hard previous-working-commit
git push --force-with-lease origin main
```

## 📞 **Support & Coordination**

- **Daily standups**: Check progress and blockers
- **Weekly integration**: Test merged features together
- **Conflict resolution**: Coordinate with affected team members
- **Documentation**: Update README and docs with new features

This workflow ensures clean, organized development while maintaining code quality and team coordination! 🎉
